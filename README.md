# Kubernetes DoS Simulation

This project provides YAML configurations to simulate a Denial of Service (DoS) attack on a Kubernetes API server. It is intended for **educational and research purposes only**.

## Disclaimer
**This project is for educational and research purposes only.** Use this code in a controlled environment or with explicit permission. Unauthorized use to attack production systems or networks is unethical and illegal. The author is not responsible for any misuse of this project.

## Purpose
The goal of this project is to:
- Demonstrate how Kubernetes clusters can be stressed under heavy API load.
- Provide insights into resource management and DoS mitigation strategies.

## Files
- `api-dos-pod.yaml`: Configuration for a single attacker pod.
- `api-dos-deployment.yaml`: Deployment for scaling multiple attacker pods.

## Usage
Follow the instructions in the YAML files to deploy the simulation in a controlled environment.
